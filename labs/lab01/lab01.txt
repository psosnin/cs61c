Compile C with gcc program.c, which produces an executable a.out that can be run with ./a.out
Can specify output file name using -o, such as gcc -o program program.c

We can use the -g flag to store debugging information in the executable program that we can extract with gdb. 
For example, 
gcc -g -o hello hello.c
cgdb hello
